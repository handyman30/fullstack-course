# âœ… Stripe Setup Complete!

## What's Been Done

1. **Created STRIPE_CONFIG.md** - Contains all your Stripe keys (test and live)

2. **Updated the codebase** - Removed hardcoded keys, now using environment variables

3. **Created .env.local** - Your local environment file with test keys

4. **Security verified** - .env.local is in .gitignore (won't be committed)

## Your Keys Are Now Active

- **Test Mode**: Currently using test keys for development
- **Publishable Key**: `pk_test_51N1UFkCcsYqHROqx...` (safe to expose)
- **Secret Key**: `sk_test_51N1UFkCcsYqHROqx...` (keep secret!)

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your dev server** to load the new keys:
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C) then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test a payment**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3002/subscribe
   - Click "Start Your Free Trial"
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry date
   - Any 3-digit CVC
   - Any billing info

3. **Check your Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Test mode: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/
   - You should see the test payments

## When Ready for Production

See `STRIPE_CONFIG.md` for instructions on switching to live keys.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Missing STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY", restart the dev server
- Make sure you're on port 3002 (or update NEXTAUTH_URL)
- Check the console for any Stripe-related errors

Your Stripe integration is ready to go! ðŸš€
