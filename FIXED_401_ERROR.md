# Fixed: 401 Unauthorized Error After Sign-Up

## Problem
When users signed up with a new account, they would get a 401 Unauthorized error when the system tried to automatically sign them in.

## Root Cause
Next.js API routes run in separate contexts, so the USERS_DB Map couldn't be properly shared between the signup route and the auth route. The signup route would store the user, but the auth route couldn't see it.

## Solution
Created a shared module lib/users-db.ts that:
1. Uses the Node.js global object to persist data across routes
2. Maintains a single instance of the users database during development
3. Is imported by both the signup and auth routes

### New File Structure:
- lib/users-db.ts - Shared user storage module
- app/api/auth/signup/ - Uses shared module
- app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/ - Uses shared module

## How It Works Now
1. User fills out sign-up form
2. /api/auth/signup creates the user and stores in shared USERS_DB
3. Automatic sign-in calls /api/auth/[...nextauth] 
4. Auth route can now find the user in the shared USERS_DB
5. User is successfully signed in and redirected to subscription page

## Testing
Try signing up with a new account now - it should work seamlessly:
1. Go to /auth/signup
2. Enter any email/password
3. You'll be automatically signed in
4. Redirected to the subscription page

The 401 error is now fixed!
