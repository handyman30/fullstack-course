## üìù Notes for Next Developer/Thread

The landing page is complete and optimized for conversion. The next critical step is payment integration to start collecting trials. The design is intentionally dark with purple/blue gradients to appeal to the tech audience. All components are modular and can be easily extended.

Key files:
- `/app/page.tsx` - Main landing page
- `/app/layout.tsx` - SEO metadata
- `/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
- `/app/globals.css` - Global styles

The countdown timer and student counter are currently client-side simulations. These should be connected to real data once the backend is implemented.
